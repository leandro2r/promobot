# PromoBot

Promobot is a customizable web scraper made with some of the most used python libraries such as Requests, Selenium, and BeautifulSoup. This solution monitors websites by searching keywords occurrences and reporting to a Telegram chatbot.

The customization is the main resource which is the algorithm able to use any URL once you say the HTML tags where itâ€™ll look to the keywords and get the link to share in Telegram.

The default customizations are classified in the country/region list (BR, CA, etc) and you can find them at `config/promobot.yml`.
